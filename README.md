"Hand Sign Classifier using CNN" is a deep learning project which classify hand signs in real-time.

Step 1: Create Your Custom Dataset
Use the provided ImageUtil.ipynb file in utils folder to create your custom dataset. 
Modify it to suit your image categories and data collection requirements.

Step 2: Train Your Model
Now, it's time to train your image classifier. You can use the HandSigns.ipynb file as a starting point. 
Feel free to adjust the CNN architecture or hyperparameters as needed.

Step 3: Real-Time Classification
Once your model is trained, you can experiment with ModelTesting.ipynb file for real-time image classification. 
Open your webcam and load your trained model using the provided code.
